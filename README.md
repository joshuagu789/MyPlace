# MyPlace
Hi! If you see this: welcome to my personal place! This project uses Pycharm with Django to create my personal progress log app 
that also showcases my game in development. I have been following a book called Python Crash Course but have been adding my own add-ons to it.
The book appears to be intending for the app to be available for all users to create accounts on rather than a personal place for me to present
what I have learned, but we will see how it goes in the future.
